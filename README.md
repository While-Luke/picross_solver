# picross_solver

I won't claim that this is the fastest algorithm to solve a picross puzzle, but it is entirely my own idea and work.

# Usage

Set the size of the board you want with the sliders. Enter the numbers of the puzzle by selecting a row/column then type in the numbers with a space inbetween each one (to allow for more than single digit numbers). Press ENTER to stop editing a row/column or click on the next row/column that you wish to edit. Once you ahve entered all the numbers for the puzzle, press the solve button to instantly solve the puzzle.
This program can also be used to manualy solve a puzzle by left-clickin the fill and square on the board and right-click to cross it out.
